ldesc: "Several small utilities have been combined into this package. 
The GGZ Metaserver is part of it, as is ggz-cmd, the command client for 
the server. Developers can make use of the communication protocol 
generator (ggzcommgen). Also, a collection of MOTDs and a telnet wrapper 
is included for server admins."
